George was professional and answered a lot of my questions. They asked for 2-3 days when we wish our cars to be picked up. They called a few days in advance before picked up to arrange that it was going to get picked up on a Friday morning. We had to drive the cars to a nearest bigger parking lot as our street wasn’t big enough for the truck. We got our cars in 1 week. Got a call a day in advance that cars were on the way, got a few hours time range. Then the truck came into nearest residential street where they can turn. We walked there to pick up our cars. No damage or scratches but very dusty.. all good after a car wash.</p>

                                            <p>Professional, reliable and reasonable priced. We moved 2 cars from Connecticut to Southern CA recently. George was professional and answered a lot of my questions. They asked for 2-3 days when we wish our cars to be picked up. They called a few days in advance before picked up to arrange that it was going to get picked up on a Friday morning. We had to drive the cars to a nearest bigger parking lot as our street wasn’t big enough for the truck. We got our cars in 1 week. Got a call a day in advance that cars were on the way, got a few hours time range. Then the truck came into nearest residential street where they can turn. We walked there to pick up our cars. No damage or scratches but very dusty.. all good after a car wash.</p>

                                            <p>Professional, reliable and reasonable priced. We moved 2 cars from Connecticut to Southern CA recently. George was professional and answered a lot of my questions. They asked for 2-3 days when we wish our cars to be picked up. They called a few days in advance before picked up to arrange that it was going to get picked up on a Friday morning. We had to drive the cars to a nearest bigger parking lot as our street wasn’t big enough for the truck. We got our cars in 1 week. Got a call a day in advance that cars were on the way, got a few hours time range. Then the truck came into nearest residential street where they can turn. We walked there to pick up our cars. No damage or scratches but very dusty.. all good after a car wash.</p>

                                            <p>Professional, reliable and reasonable priced. We moved 2 cars from Connecticut to Southern CA recently. George was professional and answered a lot of my questions. They asked for 2-3 days when we wish our cars to be picked up. They called a few days in advance before picked up to arrange that it was going to get picked up on a Friday morning. We had to drive the cars to a nearest bigger parking lot as our street wasn’t big enough for the truck. We got our cars in 1 week. Got a call a day in advance that cars were on the way, got a few hours time range. Then the truck came into nearest residential street where they can turn. We walked there to pick up our cars. No damage or scratches but very dusty.. all good after a car wash.</p>
